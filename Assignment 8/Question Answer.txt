Q.) Why don't we need to worry about privacy leaks with respect to the accountHolder 
instance variable in BankAccount?

A.) We don't need to worry about privacy leaks because even if you had access to a pointer or
object of the customer/accountHolder class, you could not change its' values because they
were declared "Final", and therefore are immutable after its initial creation. There are also
no setter methods present.
